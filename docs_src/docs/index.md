# X2WOTCCommunityHighlander Documentation

## Current status of the Documentation

The documentation is freshly introduced. It will take us a while
to document all old features, but it is expected that new features all come
with their documentation page.

## How to read

The nav bar has a list of features. Click on a feature to view that feature's
documentation. Every feature has:

* A GitHub tracking issue for discussion
* A documented way to use it, for example with an event tuple (TODO: Document Tuples)
* Code references that link to HL source code where the documentation is

## Contribute

Documentation is placed inside of source code (`.uc` and `.ini`) files. Click any
source code reference on an existing page for examples. We're especially happy to
accept pull requests that add documentation for old features.
